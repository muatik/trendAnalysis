The goal of these backend services and the widgets is to present user system detected trends and main topics of a market sector, based on the information gathered by the Social Media Linked Data Space Crawlers. In this way, users can have a quick insight about a specific market sector, company, product, campaign or service they defined.

Trend analysis is performed on data stored in the SMLDS module and results are offered to the UI widgets through a layer of REST web services. The system is implemented with a caching system that prevents queries to be recalculated every time they are requested: once a specific request of trend calculation is received, itâ€™s be possible to access the snapshot in future for further manipulation (e. g. visualisation in the widgets to show different aspects of report), without requiring a new recalculation of the whole result.

The implementation relies on statistical methods to tackle the issue of multilingualism, and eliminates the need for specific NLP solutions for each language: collected data is cleaned from noise and then tokenised, counting their occurrences based on their frequency in the overall data set, and a distribution analysis is performed on the data to detect trending keywords. Stop-words and periodic events are eliminated at this step, since their frequencies follow a predictable pattern.

The next step of trend analysis is to trace back the trending keywords to the specific topics (in documents) that generated the increment of frequency, and this is performed using locality sensitive hashing algorithms.
